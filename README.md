##I. Design assumptions
CoolKey is a cross-platform program for learning to touch type (using all ten fingers). Includes course consists of a series of lessons, allowing for mastering another keyboard keys, starting with "asdf", "jkl;" etc. CoolKey tracks the user and depending on the results of the exercises chosen difficulty level (introducing new keys or suggesting repeat lessons). You can choose between two types of exercise: a standard prescription of a given text, or playing in involving the rapid typing game. Once you have mastered the entire keyboard, you can train your typing speed by rewriting literary texts of varying difficulty, or text generated using Markov chain.

Program features:
